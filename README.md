# SaaS Notes Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This SaaS application allows users to take notes in a rich-text editor, similar to MS Word, while viewing **PDFs and videos side by side**. It enhances productivity by allowing users to **watch videos and read PDFs while taking notes simultaneously**. Notes can be saved and accessed later from any device.
